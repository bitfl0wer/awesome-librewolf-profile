# üê∫ awesome-librewolf-profile

A (my personal) LibreWolf template that makes the browser less fingerprinting-proof, but more usable on the current web. Features add-ons like uBlock, LocalCDN, CanvasBlocker and more.

## üí° About

I often switch between or reinstall Linux distributions and therefore tend to set up my browser a lot. I dislike wasting time on this and therefore created this repository. There might be a better way to do what I am trying to accomplish, but storing a pre-configured LibreWolf profile in git seems good enough to me.
