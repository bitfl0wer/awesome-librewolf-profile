# üê∫ awesome-librewolf-profile

A (my personal) LibreWolf template that makes the browser less fingerprinting-proof, but more usable on the current web. Features add-ons like uBlock, LocalCDN, CanvasBlocker and more.

## üí° About

I often switch between or reinstall Linux distributions and therefore tend to set up my browser a lot. I dislike wasting time on this and therefore created this repository. There might be a better way to do what I am trying to accomplish, but storing a pre-configured LibreWolf profile in git seems good enough to me.

### üí≠ What has been changed compared to a base LibreWolf install?

Not much, actually! Here is a list of preferences that have been changed, compared to a fresh LibreWolf profile:
* DRM content can be viewed
* The start/new tab page has been slightly changed
* Automatic history, cookie and download history cleaning has been disabled
* Sent search queries and form entries will be saved instead of discarded
* userChrome.css customization has been enabled 
* ResistFingerprinting and "silently block canvas access requests" have been disabled
* WebGL has been enabled

## üß© Plugins included

* uBlock Origin
* Bitwarden
* Dark Reader
* Stylus
* LocalCDN
* Canvas Blocker
* Tab Stash
* YouTube Channel Whitelist for uBlock Origin

## üíª Installation
